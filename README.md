# Trippy-Shaderpack
Here's a conglomeration my crazy Minecraft shaders all in one shaderpack!
There are plenty of options to tweak.

To install, download this and insert it in the .minecraft/shaderpacks folder. If you want to save space you can extract the zip and delete everything outside (screenshots, github stuff) of the shaders folder.
