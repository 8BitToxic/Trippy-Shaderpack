# Trippy-Shaderpack
Here's a conglomeration of my crazy Minecraft shaders all in one shaderpack! There are plenty of settings to tweak waviness, color intensity, distortion, curvature and more.

To use this pack, [download the shaders here](https://github.com/XorDev/Trippy-Shaderpack/archive/master.zip) and put them in you .minecraft/shaderpacks folder.
NOTE: You need to get [Optifine](https://optifine.net/downloads) first!

send me screenshots on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/XorDev)!
